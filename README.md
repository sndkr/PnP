PnP has been going through some refactoring, so some of the components and areas have been relocated to own repositories for easier consumption. This PnP repo is still the main repository for the components, samples and solutions (more ready to be used samples). Here's also other resources around PnP.

- [PnP at dev.office.com](http://aka.ms/OfficeDevPnP) - Welcome page with sample and guidance search
- [PnP Yammer Group](http://aka.ms/OfficeDevPnPYammer) - Questions and feedback
- [PnP at MSDN](http://aka.ms/OfficeDevPnPMSDN)
- [PnP videos](http://aka.ms/OfficeDevPnPVideos) at Channel 9

***Notice**. There are different kind of techniques shown in the PnP guidance for apps/add-ins targetted to store and also for apps targeted to be deployed or created more as enterprise developmented apps/add-ins. Any app/add-in which requires higher than **Manage** permission to the host web cannot be distributed using SharePoint store.*
